claude-mantra
I told you. You agreed. You forgot. Repeat.

Claude is brilliant. Claude is helpful. Claude also has the memory of a goldfish in a context window.
You've written the perfect CLAUDE.md. You've carefully documented your project conventions, architectural decisions, and coding standards. Claude reads it. Claude agrees it's excellent guidance. Claude then proceeds to ignore half of it by turn 47.
claude-mantra solves this by periodically re-injecting key instruction files into Claude's working context—reinforcing the behavioral guidance you've already provided before it fades into the abyss of distant tokens.

Think of it as a parent walking into the room every 20 minutes to say "Remember what we talked about?"—except automated, and without the disappointed sigh.

Features:

Configurable refresh intervals (by turn count, token threshold, or on-demand)
Selective file targeting (refresh your architecture rules without re-reading the whole codebase)
Lightweight injection (summaries or full files, your choice)
Works with existing CLAUDE.md, project docs, or custom instruction files

Why "mantra"?
A mantra is a phrase repeated to focus the mind. Claude's mind wanders. This brings it back.

I'd like to extract the ideas from this agent
- /Users/dpuglielli/github/flexion/claude-domestique/agents/context-refresh.md
- need to decide what we are making -- skill, agent, MCP, other
- keep it as unobtrusive as possible
- keep the scope as narrow as possile for the plugin
- I'd like the tooling/scripting to be in java script (node) to make the tools cross-platform -- node is a base requirement for claude to run.
- allow for flexible structures to hold context
- Make the freshness of the context apparent with every prompt response -- this is a context drift detector for the user
- Do not overwhelm working context with context reenforcement -- we neext context to do actual work and not just how to do the work
- make the refresh fast but obvious that it happened
- upstream project is https://github.com/flexion/claude-mantra.git
- copy /Users/dpuglielli/github/flexion/claude-domestique/context into this project under ./claude/context
  - change the files to pertain to this project
  - instruct claude to use them for developing this plugin
- When ready we want this project to dog-food its own plugin.
