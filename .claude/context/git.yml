MANDATORY-REREAD: before-commit, before-PR (use-thinking-block-verification)

## COMMIT CHECKLIST (you are reading this because you're about to commit):
✓ Tests run if applicable (npm test)
✓ Session file updated (atomic commit: session+code together)
✓ Format: "#N - verb desc" OR "chore - desc" (lowercase!)
✓ HEREDOC with bullets
✓ ZERO attribution/co-authored-by/emojis

## PR CHECKLIST (you are reading this because you're about to create PR):
✓ Tests run if applicable (npm test)
✓ Title format: "#N - lowercase desc" OR "chore - lowercase desc" (MATCHES commit format)
✓ Body has ZERO: attribution, emojis, AI mentions, co-authored-by
✓ Base branch: main (or project default)
✓ Re-read this checklist in thinking block BEFORE running gh pr create

branch-from: main (git-fetch-first, remote-main)
branch: issue/feature-N/desc | chore/desc
commit: |
  "#N - verb desc" OR "chore - desc"
  - change1
  - change2
  (use HEREDOC format)
no: attribution, co-authored-by, emojis, --amend (except pre-commit hooks)
test-before: npm test (when package.json exists)
pr-base: main (or project default branch)
verify: 'git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch" (check remote HEAD matches pr-base)'
ask-first: "Is this an issue or chore?" + get issue number (never guess)

  commit-chore: "chore - update dependencies\n- Update typescript to latest version"
  pr-issue: "#3 - add context refresh hook"
