# .claude/context Format Guide - Compact Reference

## Reading Compact YAML
patterns:
  flow: "→" (hook → inject → refresh)
  priority: ">" (unit > integration > e2e)
  list: commas (test: new-logic, conditionals, errors)
  alternatives: "|" (issue/feature-N/desc | chore/desc)
  negation: "no:", "skip:", "never:"
  inline-examples: parens (branch: pattern (example: issue/feature-3/auth))

interpret:
  "test: a, b, c": test ALL of these
  "skip: x, y, z": don't test ANY of these
  "a > b > c": priority order (a highest)
  "a → b → c": flow/sequence (a to b to c)
  "a | b": either is valid

## Writing Compact YAML
do: shortest-phrasing, no-articles, operators (→ > |), key:value, one-fact-per-line
dont: prose, explanations, complete-sentences, markdown-formatting, redundancy

size-targets:
  simple: 5-12 lines
  config: 10-20 lines
  max: 30 lines

## Purpose
for: claude (machine-optimized, fast parsing, minimal tokens)
not-for: humans (use *.md files for docs)
benefit: 89% token reduction (~7,750 → ~850 tokens)
